# Sudoku

The Board class serves as a representation of a Sudoku puzzle board, featuring methods for verifying the validity of numbers within rows, columns, and 3x3 squares. It initializes with a provided 9x9 puzzle and offers functionalities like finding the first empty cell, checking the validity of numbers in rows and columns, and validating numbers within the corresponding 3x3 square. Additionally, it employs a backtracking algorithm in its solver method to systematically fill in empty cells with valid numbers, adhering to Sudoku rules. The solve_sudoku function utilizes this class, printing the original puzzle, attempting to solve it using the solver method, and then displaying the solved puzzle or indicating if it's unsolvable. This approach systematically explores possible solutions, backtracking when necessary, until a valid solution is found or it determines the puzzle is unsolvable.
